\section{Summary}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
I first learned of \textbf{virtualization} technology in a
\textbf{dynamic binary translating} project in 2009. Joined in
\textit{AMD} as a software engineer in semi-conductor industry after
graduation. Engaged in development of \textbf{linux graphics software stack} for
3 years. Then I served in \textbf{cloud computing} field for 2 years and restart
virtualization research on GPU.\\
Recently I'm interested in \textbf{AI/DNN} accelerating technology, expect to figure
out a programming model balancing performance and programmability under specific
hardware constraints.
